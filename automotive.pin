# Ross Burton, Userspace Architect for Yocto
# Open Source Technology Centre at Intel
# This session is a high level introduction to the Yocto Project

What is the Yocto Project?

# Appears to be confusion in the automotive community about the Yocto Project.
# What is is, what it can offer and so on.
# We were invited by the LF to come here and clarify what Yocto is.
# So, the Yocto Project is...

-- [umbrella.jpg]

Umbrella project

# An umbrella project.
# You don't download or install the Yocto Project itself
# Just like you don't install the Apache Foundation

-- [tools.jpg]

Build environment
and development tools

# A build environment and development tools for that environment.
# Specifically, a build system (bitbake), package metadata (oe-core),
# Eclipse plugin, Application Development Toolkit (deployable toolchain)

-- [cpus.jpg] [text-align=center] [center]

x86 • ARM
MIPS • PowerPC

# We support all of the big architectures.
# Core metadata builds for qemu machines for all of these architectures
# Ensures that the core builds for everything
# Optional BSPs for specific platform support
# Everything is cross compiled, so no "but it worked for x86" problems

-- [people.jpg]

Collaboration space

# Finally YP is a collaboration space, providing a forum
# for diverse users to share their problems and solutions
# Public mailing lists and weekly phone conference

# PAUSE

So many choices…

# When picking a platform 
# what's the difference between yocto and android, linaro, tizen, buildroot,
# or hacking your favourite desktop distribution...

-- [engineer.jpg]

…why pick the Yocto Project?

# linux for embedded, from a small ARM to mission critical xeon clusters
# builds a custom distro suited to your needs
# easy to add, remove, or change components
# tools to help do distribution building
# - package repos and image generation
# - static release archives for license compliance

-- [cables.jpg]

Some are easy to hack on,
but you’ll regret that later

# debugging when you need to rebuild
# switching hardware or toolchain
# commercial support
# TODO

-- [road.jpg] [top]

Designed for the long term

# six monthly release cycle but maintained release branches
# generate archives for gpl compliance
# reproducable builds for the entire system

-- [tumble.jpg] [top]

Won’t fall apart in time

# upgrades (hack fedora and ship, 1 year later need to ship an update... how?)
# GPL compliance (source *and* build instructions, more so for hack-a-distro)
# TODO

Who is in the Yocto Project?

Hardware manufacturers

# i.e. Intel, Texas Instruments, Freescale

Embedded OSVs

# i.e. Wind River, MontaVista, Enea Software, Mentor Graphics

Consultants and individuals

# Consultants
# individuals "scratching an itch" for their own projects

Advisory Board

# TODO OWN WORDS
# YP is a project at the Linux Foundation. Its overseen by an advisory board
# made up of representatives of the member companies who provide the resources
# working on the project. The advisory board's first decision was to rename
# itself to an "advisory board" rather than anything else like committee or a
# steering group to reflect that the day to day running of the project is in the
# hands of the architects and maintainers. Its considered a failure if the AB
# ever had to get involved in technical decisions! This illustrates the open
# source collaboration and development model that flows to the core of the
# project.

How does it work?

# Enough about what the Yocto Project can do
# How does it do it?

- [cake.jpg]

It’s all about the layers

# A YP build is assembled from a number of layers
# Layers are modular and you can combine layers from different sources

Let's build something!

$ <b>tar xjf poky-denzil-7.0.tar.bz2</b>
$ <b>cd poky-denzil-7.0</b></tt>

# One of the downloads from the Yocto Project is Poky, a reference distribution.
# This is basically Bitbake, oe-core, and meta-yocto glued together for convenience
# Grabbing and extracting the tarball of the 7.0 "denzil" release is as you'd expect

<tt> $ <b>./oe-init-build-env</b>
 ### Shell environment set up for builds. 
 ### You can now run 'bitbake &lt;target&gt;‘
 Common targets are:
   core-image-minimal
   core-image-sato
 …
 $ <b>emacs conf/local.conf</b></tt>

# First you need to source a shell script to setup the environment. 
# Now lets have a quick look at the configuration file

- [corridor.jpg] [center]

<tt> # BB_NUMBER_THREADS = "4"
 # PARALLEL_MAKE = "-j 4"
 
 MACHINE ??= "qemux86"
 …
 #MACHINE ?= "qemuarm"
 #MACHINE ?= "qemumips"
 #MACHINE ?= "atom-pc"
 #MACHINE ?= "beagleboard"</tt>

# Just a small fragment of the options available.  Defaults are all reasonable
# and it will successfully build out of the box.

# For a faster build, change the parallel options. My build machine is a quad
# core with hyperthreading, so I set both of those to 8.

# Default target is x86 on qemu.  This is trivially changed by simply changing
# the MACHINE variable.

# Other options include where to keep downloaded tarballs; location of any
# mirrors; features to enable such as multiarch, installing the toolchain in the
# image for development, what package format to use, and more.

- [corridor.jpg] [center]

 <tt>$ <b>bitbake core-image-minimal</b></tt>

# Then, you can run bitbake with the name of the target you want
# Targets can be anything - images, packages, or operations.
# Let's build core-image-minimal, a fairly small system that boots to a console

# When it finishes building the results are in the deploy directory
# Here we can see the constructed root file system as a cpio archive,
# a bare filesystem, a bootable ISO image, and a disk image.
# Generally I'd be writing the disk image to a fast USB stick and booting from
# that for testing.

# The build output is configurable per build and per machine. This build was for
# a fairly standard Intel system so the final output is typically bootable on
# those.  Build for a say beagleboard and you'll get kernel, bootloader and
# rootfs tarballs to write a SD card.

# alongside the images directory there is the package repository that was used
# to construct the root fs. This can be shared on the network and used as a
# normal repository, ie install some development or debug symbol packages to fix
# a bug.

TODO hob demo if I can make it work

Now what?

# So that's how to build an image, but what could we do with it?

- [dolls.jpg] [top]

Use Case: Virtualisation

# I expect virtualisation to be common in next-generation automotive systems as
# individual processors become more powerful and logically separate systems are
# ran in virtual machines on fewer physical processors.

# Because systems built by Yocto can be trivially tuned to be exactly what is
# required and nothing else they are a good match for virtualised systems, both
# as a minimal host that does simply manages the virtual machines, or as a
# specialized virtual machine itself.

- [dash.jpg] [top]

Use Case: single purpose system

# TODO
# Any of the numerous specalised embedded devices in a car
# Such as dashboard, engine management
